This notebook will walk you step by step through the process of training a fast-rcnn model for object detection, evaluating it during the training, and using a pre-trained model to detect objects in some images. The object detection demo uses the Tensorflow Object Detection API, which is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.

    "\n",
    "1. The `model` configuration. This defines what type of model will be trained (ie. meta-architecture, feature extractor).\n",
    "2. The `train_config`, which decides what parameters should be used to train model parameters (ie. the training speed, input preprocessing).\n",
    "3. The `eval_config`, which determines what set of metrics will be reported for evaluation.\n",
    "4. The `train_input_config`, which defines what dataset the model should be trained on.\n",
    "5. The `eval_input_config`, which defines what dataset the model will be evaluated on. Typically this should be different than the training input dataset.\n",

Here we use the faster RCNN model with inception v2 neural network for training, whose configuration file is `faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets.config`. You can copy it into the `./config` directory and check the parameters in the file."
